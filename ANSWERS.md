1. Node.js is javascript runtime environment who's purpose is to use javascript
in backend production. It allows us to run web servers, to create command line
tools, networking services and other lower level or OS level software.

2. Express at its core is just a node module. It is a lightweight framework that
sits on top of Node.js and abstracts away much of the code used for common tasks.
A multiline node server can be written in just three lines of express. It allows
node to be connected with middleware, it helps serve single page applications and
other views from the backend, and it provides easy to use client-side routing
features.
